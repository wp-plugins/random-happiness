$happy_thoughts = "Happiness
Stop focusing on how stressed you are and remember how blessed you are. It could be so much worse.
Give as much as you can, but don't allow yourself to be used. Listen to others closely, but don't lose your own voice.
It is not what happens to you, but how you respond to what happens to you. Count your blessings while others are adding up their troubles.
Negative company will never give you a positive life. Examine what you tolerate in the long-term.
It only takes one person to make you happy and change your life: YOU.
Set an example. Treat everyone with kindness and respect, even those who are rude to you â€“ not because they are nice, but because you are.
When other people treat you poorly, walk away, smile and keep being YOU. Don't ever let someone else's bitterness change the person you are.
One of the most freeing things we learn in life is that we don't have to like everyone, everyone doesn't have to like us, and that's OK.
Your life will improve only when you take small chances, and the first and most difficult chance you can take is to be honest with yourself.
Your value doesn't decrease based on someone's inability to see your worth. It's their loss, not yours.
The greater part of progress is the desire to progress.
Chase the vision, not the money; the money will end up following you.
Don't worry about failure; you only have to be right once.
The only thing that makes it a part of your life is that you keep thinking about it.
Be happy for this moment. This moment is your life. -Omar Khayyam
It is not how much we have, but how much we enjoy, that makes happiness. Charles Spurgeon
Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions. Dalai Lama
There is only one happiness in this life, to love and be loved. George Sand
People who do new things - learn a game, travel to unfamiliar places - are happier than people who stick to familiar activities that they already do well.
Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony. Mahatma Gandhi
It is not easy to find happiness in ourselves, and it is not possible to find it elsewhere. Agnes Repplier
Most folks are as happy as they make up their minds to be. Abraham Lincoln
Exercise is one of the most dependable mood-boosters. Even a 10-minute walk can brighten my outlook.
40 percent of your happiness level is within your control. Taking time to reflect, and making conscious steps to make your life happier
Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it. Bruce Lee
Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them.  Bruce Lee
If you can't make it good, at least make it look good. Bill Gates
Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning. Bill Gates
Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works. Steve Jobs
Some cause happiness wherever they go; others whenever they go.  Oscar Wilde";
